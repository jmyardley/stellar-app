# Stellar Covid Test Scheduler App

**About the App/project**

**Description:** An application used to schedule covid test for anyone who wants to know their status. The app will also show availability and non-availability. The individual will sign up using their name, email address, and create a password. If they have already signed up, they will simply login using their email address and password.

**Motivation for development:** We are all in this together,  so knowing your covid status is important so that we can help slow down the spread of the virus. 

**User story** As a user who wants to know my covid status, I want to be able to access a secure site/app so that I can schedule an appointment.

**Technologies used:** MySQL, Node, Bootstrap, Javascript, Heroku

**Future Development:**
-Add a secure way for users to see their test results 
-Location tracker for testing sites
