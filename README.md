Description: An application used to schedule covid test for anyone who wants to know their status. The app will also show availability and non-availability. The individual will sign up using their name, email address, and create a password. If they have already signed up, they will simply login using their email address and password.

Motivation for development: We are all in this together,  so knowing your covid status is important so that we can help slow down the spread of the virus. 

User story: As a user who wants to know my covid status, I want to be able to access a secure site/app so that I can schedule an appointment.

Technologies used: MySQL, Node, Bootstrap, Javascript, Heroku

Directions for future development:
-Add a secure way for users to see their test results 
-Location tracker for testing sites
